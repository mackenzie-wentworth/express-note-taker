## Description
For this week's Challenge, I was tasked to build the back end of a note-taking application using `Express.js` so that it connects to the front end of a given starter code to save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.


## User Story
```
AS A small business owner
I WANT to be able to write and save notes
SO THAT I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete
```


## Usage
The **Express Note Taker** serves as a tool for users to write and save notes all in one application. 

### *How to Use the Express Note Taker:*
The following images demonstrate the appearance and functionality of the Express Note Taker web application:

After clicking on "Get Started" from the homepage, users will be taken to a page that displays all previously saved notes in the menu on the left-side of the page.

To create and save a **new note**, users can edit the 'Note Title' and 'Note Text' fields. Once the user has added text to both fields, then a `save icon` will appear in the top-right corner of the page to click and save their new note.
