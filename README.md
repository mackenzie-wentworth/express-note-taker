## Description
For this week's Challenge, I was tasked to build the back end of a note-taking application using `Express.js` so that it connects to the front end of a given starter code to save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.

## User Story

```
AS A small business owner
I WANT to be able to write and save notes
SO THAT I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete
```


## Usage
The *Express Note Taker* serves as a tool for users to write and save notes all in one application. 

The following images demonstrate the appearance and functionality of the Express Note Taker web application:
